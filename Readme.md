# CppMermaidGen

Small utility quickly made to generate Mermaid class diagram directly from cpp source files
To use it just edit the path and the blacklist in main.cpp and run !

I know the code is awful but i needed it fast to submit a beautiful graph for a school project
Please don't look at the code
Please
